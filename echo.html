		Memories from across Social Media/General Conversations with people:<br><br>

		"Family in my home country that I'm 'too American' while the states say I'm Latino to be here."<br><br>

		"I basically existed in two worlds. In one, I had my family’s culture. In the other, I was going to school in the South. The main part were the language barrier, my parents didn’t know English so I often had to figure things out for myself for school."<br><br>

		"Being called Mexican racial slurs at times just because I spoke Spanish despite not being Mexican."<br><br>

		Everyone's experience as they live in the U.S. is different. Growing up in the states while retaining your cultural heritage is a complex life-long challenge.

			<h1>The Echo Chamber</h1>
			<p>
				Only fitting to call it the echo chamber, when all the voice ever repeats the words of the day.<br><br>

				Sometimes it's your parents' words...<br><br>

				Other times the voice sound likes friends...<br><br>

				And every once in a while, that voice takes on the sound of a stranger. And not just any stranger, an entitled one who sees you less than who you truly are. <br><br>

				Is this the path you understand?
