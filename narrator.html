		In the United States, while often used interchangeably, there is a distinct difference in identifying as Hispanic and/or Latino.<br><br>
		To identify as Hispanic means that you have the ancestry of a Spanish-speaking country.<br><br>
		To identify as Latino/Latina/Latinx/Latin√© means that you have ancestry of a country that is in Latin America.<br><br>
		For example, A person from Spain would be considered Hispanic but not Latino. Spain is not part of Latin America, so anyone who is from Spain wouldn't identify as Latino.<br><br>

		On the other hand, a person from Brazil would be Latino, but not Hispanic. Brazil's primary language is Portuguese, not Spanish, so someone from Brazil would only identify as Latino because Brazil IS in Latin America.
